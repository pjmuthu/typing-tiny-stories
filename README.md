# Typing Tiny Stores

**Typing Tiny Stores** is an interactive typing game that combines the challenge of typing accuracy with AI-generated storytelling. Players are presented with short stories generated by a specialized Large Language Model (LLM). The objective is to type the text accurately as it appears on the screen. Correctly typed words allow players to contribute their own lines, which the LLM continues to build upon, creating a collaborative storytelling experience.

- **Uses raylib**: This build utilizes [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for graphics and user interface. Refer to the [raylib documentation](https://www.raylib.com/) for installation and setup instructions.
- **Designed for WASM**: This version is designed to compile for WebAssembly (WASM), but can be adapted for native systems.
- **Built on Tiny Stories Dataset**: The AI model is trained on the [TinyStories dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories), a collection of short stories with a limited vocabulary suitable for children.
- **LLM Architecture**: Uses a llama2 transformer/tokenizer architecture optimized for 'small' models (<300K parameters), adhering to LLM standards.
- **Proof-of-Concept**: Intended to showcase the capabilities of focused Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive applications.
